The designer identifies a client and their communication needs, and details the purpose, context, audience and users as well as a list of constraints. - *Develop:* Using divergent thinking strategies to seek and analyse inspiration from a wider range of sources, generating imaginative ideas aligned with the communication need. The designer uses methods, media, materials, design elements and design principles to create, recreate and explore the potential of design ideas. - *Deliver:* Using convergent thinking strategies to reflect critically on their ideas. The designer uses design criteria and feedback to select potential solutions and concepts to evaluate and refine further. They choose appropriate formats to communicate and present finished design solutions."
