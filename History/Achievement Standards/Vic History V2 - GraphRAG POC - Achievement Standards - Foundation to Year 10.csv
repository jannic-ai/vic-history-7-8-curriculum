History,Foundation to Level 2,"By the end of Level 2, students identify continuity and change in personal, family and community life. They describe significant aspects of personal and family life, and of an individual, a site or an event in their community. They identify how changing technology has influenced the daily life of their families and close connections and in the wider community. Students ask historical questions to investigate the past and sequence significant events in the past and in their lives in chronological order. Students identify the features and content of sources and the perspectives of people in the past and present. They identify continuities and changes in daily life by comparing the past and the present and identify the causes and consequences of those changes. They identify significant individuals, events and places in their families and community. Students communicate an account of their lives, their family and close connections and community using historical terms and information from sources."
History,Levels 3 and 4,"By the end of Level 4, students describe continuity and change in their community and the significance of events, symbols and emblems in the celebration of Australia’s identity and diversity. They describe the significant events and the experiences and perspectives of people in Australia between 1750 and 1800. They describe causes and consequences of early colonisation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, new arrivals and the environment. Students ask a range of historical questions to identify evidence of the experiences of people in the past. They sequence events and life stories in chronological order to identify continuity and change in their community and in early colonial Australia. They identify the features and contexts of different primary and secondary historical sources. Students describe the perspectives of people in the past and why historical interpretations differ. Students identify and describe continuity and change in the community and in the early colonisation of Australia. They describe the causes and consequences of changes in local communities and the early colonisation of Australia. Students describe why events, symbols, emblems and the contributions of people from a range of backgrounds are significant to changes in communities and the early colonisation of Australia. Students describe historical developments and events using historical terms and use evidence drawn from historical sources."
History,Levels 5 and 6,"By the end of Level 6, students explain the causes and consequences of the establishment of British colonies in Australia during the 1800s and the contribution of significant individuals, events and ideas to continuity and change to Australian politics and society, including Federation and migration between 1900 and 2000. Students develop and ask questions to assist their investigation into continuity and change in Australian history between 1800 and 2000. They organise events, developments and the lives of individuals in chronological order and use that information to create a narrative. Students identify the features, content and context of primary and secondary historical sources and describe the value of evidence in sources for specific historical investigations. They describe the perspectives, beliefs, values and attitudes of people and groups in Australia’s past using evidence from primary sources. Students recognise different historical interpretations and explain why they may vary. Students identify and compare patterns of continuity and change in the events and the lives of Australians between 1800 and 2000. They explain the causes and consequences of significant events, individuals and groups during the Australian colonial period and the 20th century. Students explain the significance of events, individuals and groups as factors contributing to continuity and change in Australia during the period of study. They construct interpretations of Australian history between 1800 and 2000 using appropriate historical terms and evidence drawn from primary and secondary sources."
History,Levels 7 and 8,"By the end of Level 8, students can analyse different interpretations of the establishment of early societies, explain global patterns of continuity and change and the sources of historical evidence of the period. They can describe the historical significance of the histories of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples’ histories and cultures, ancient societies of Europe, Africa or Asia, and societies leading to the modern world between 600 and 1750 CE. Students develop and apply historical questions to support the process of historical inquiry, when using historical concepts and sources across the range of historical contexts. They order historical narratives of events, ideas and developments chronologically to explain varied patterns and forms of continuity and change and their causes and consequences. Students explain the features, content and context of primary and secondary sources and apply historical questions when drawing inferences from sources. They interpret the information from historical sources by analysing and verifying their accuracy and value as historical evidence. Students use primary and secondary sources to identify and explain the perspectives of individuals and groups and use these sources to understand the beliefs, values and attitudes of the individuals and societies studied. Students recognise the contested nature of the histories of early and pre-modern societies and apply this knowledge to identify and analyse different historical interpretations and debates. Students recognise and explain varied patterns and forms of continuity and change in the societies they have studied and identify and explain the significant events, individuals, ideas and developments that contributed continuity and change. They establish and analyse historical significance using criteria to recognise and analyse the role and contributions of individuals, events, locations, developments and legacies of the societies they have studied. When constructing historical interpretations of the societies studied, students use historical concepts, terms, concepts, relevant knowledge, conventions and evidence obtained from their analysis of primary and secondary historical sources."
History,Levels 9 and 10,"By the end of Level 10, students evaluate the significant events, developments and ideas that shaped the modern world, including histories of Australia, the world wars and the Holocaust, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples’ rights and freedoms over the period between 1750 and the early 21st century. Students formulate and adapt historical questions to support the development of historical investigations and their use of historical sources and concepts to interpret the modern world. They organise historical narratives of events, ideas and developments in chronological order to explain varied patterns and forms of continuity and change and their causes and consequences. Students analyse the key features of primary and secondary sources, their content and context, and apply historical questions when drawing inferences from them. They evaluate historical sources by verifying and corroborating their accuracy and value as historical evidence. Students use historical sources to identify and analyse the perspectives of individuals and groups in the modern world and use these perspectives to understand the beliefs, values and attitudes of the individuals and societies studied. Students recognise the contested nature of history and apply this knowledge to identify and evaluate different historical interpretations and debates. Students analyse varied patterns and forms of continuity and change and analyse the significant events, individuals, ideas and development that contributed to and resulted from them. They analyse short- and long-term causes and intended and unintended consequences of significant events, individuals, ideas and developments and their relationships to continuity and change. They use criteria informed by historical questions to evaluate the historical significance events, ideas, individuals, groups, movements and developments of the modern world. When constructing sustained historical interpretations, students use historical concepts, terms, relevant knowledge, conventions and evaluated evidence from a range of historical sources."
