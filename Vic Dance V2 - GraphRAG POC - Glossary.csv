Dance,Aesthetic knowledge,"An understanding of how the conventions, materials and techniques of a dance work together to influence the mood or emotion. Aesthetic knowledge can contribute to creating visual, aural or physical appeal to evoke an emotional response from an audience. Aesthetic knowledge can also be related to the style and form of a dance."
Dance,Audience(s),"Individuals or groups of people who experience dance performances in a range of settings and contexts (formal, informal, virtual or interactive) through intellectual, emotional and social engagement. Social and cultural factors, and the context of the creation and viewing of dance can all alter the way audiences view, engage, interpret and respond to dance works."
Dance,Asymmetrical,"Asymmetrical movement is movement whereby dancers choose to move only one side of the body. The audience will see asymmetry because the body shape of dancers is delineated on one side of the body only, or a group of dancers will create differing shapes that contrast. Asymmetry is the opposite of symmetry."
Dance,Body,"In dance, the body is the mobile figure or shape of the dancer. The body is sometimes relatively still and sometimes changing as a dancer moves in place or travels through space. Dancers may emphasise specific parts of their body in a dance phrase or use their whole body all at once."
Dance,Choreographic devices,"Choreographic devices are tools that a choreographer uses to invent and manipulate movement to create actions, movement phrases and movement motifs. Examples of choreographic devices include: - the establishment of a motif (repeated movement phrase) - augmentation (making movements larger or smaller) - abstraction (focusing on pure movement rather than a plot or story) - repetition (repeating one or more components of a dance) - accumulation (gathering and collecting; e.g. step; step, kick; step, kick, turn; step, kick, turn, jump) - inversion (taking a movement and flipping it; e.g. upward, downward, sideways) - distortion (twisting out of shape)."
Dance,Choreographic processes,"In dance there are a number of choreographic processes, including improvisation to find movement, selection of movements, arrangement of movements, refinement of movements and evaluation of movements."
Dance,Choreography,"The making of a dance by creating, selecting and arranging movements and patterns of movement to convey an intention."
Dance,Contrast,"In dance, contrast is aspects or moments that are dissimilar, created to highlight or emphasise differences between moments in the dance. Contrast may be shown through the application of the elements of dance. Contrast may also be shown as action--reaction when one dancer moves and another reacts, or call and response where the dancers in one group move and the others respond to them through movement."
Dance,Country,"The physical environment that a particular Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples' group has a relationship with. Referring to this territory as 'Country', rather than land, indicates a reciprocal and deep relationship and one where Country both owns and is owned by the People.

Dance,Elements of dance,"The elements of dance are body, time, space and energy and are the building blocks of learning in Dance. They are each defined in this glossary."
Dance,Energy,"The evidence of manipulation of qualities of movement to create variations of force and flow within movement, such as swinging, sustaining, suspending, percussive, vibratory and collapsing."
Dance,Expressive and performance skills,"In dance, expressive and performance skills are used to execute movements, to convey meaning and intention, and tell a story. These include eye focus, dynamics, energy, accent and phrasing. These skills are most evident in presentation and performance when the dancer is communicating to an audience."
Dance,Form,"Form refers to the way a dance is structured. Structuring a dance involves creating and manipulating movements that communicate the choreographer's intention. For example, the form of a dance may have an A-B form or 2 parts. It may adopt an A-B-A form where A is repeated. Or a dance may be free form, which is specific to the dance and the intention."
Dance,Intention,"The intention is the central theme or concept of the dance. It might be the vision the choreographer has for the dance and the reason for creating the dance. An intention may be to fulfil a performance purpose, explore an idea, observation, emotion or theme, explore movement possibilities in a particular style or fusion of styles, respond to a particular stimulus or generate a response in an audience."
Dance,Locomotor,"Locomotor skills and movements include running, walking, sliding, leaping, jumping, galloping and crawling. All are movements that allow a dancer to travel through the space."
Dance,Motif,An action that helps to communicate an idea in a dance. It is a movement sequence or phrase that is repeated in a dance to emphasise or convey that idea.
Dance,Movement categories,"All dance movement falls into categories such as gesture; elevation such as jumps, leaps or lifts; falling, where a dancer changes level; travelling, where a dancer traverses the space; turning, where the body is rotated; and stillness, where a movement is controlled and held."
Dance,Movement vocabulary,The total range of movements in a particular dance. Dancers can develop a personal movement vocabulary with unique actions that are developed specifically for their own body and dance works.
Dance,Place,"'Place' is significant for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. For Torres Strait Islander Peoples, 'Place' is a space mapped out that Torres Strait Islander individuals or groups occupy and regard as their own and that has varying degrees of spirituality. It includes lands, waters and sky. For Aboriginal Peoples, 'Place' refers to the special places that exist within Country, the purposes of which vary significantly. They can include places of ceremony and initiation, birth and the provision of healing and health care; places of learning; and places for Sorry Business. These places vary greatly over the various landscapes and seascapes across the continent. There are some parts of Country that have landmarks that directly relate to the ancestor spirits and the creation of existence. These are especially important as culturally significant places and need to be cared for. There are also other places on Country that are important for ceremony, as mentioned above, which are also considered especially important for Aboriginal communities."
Dance,Production elements,"In dance, production elements are creative areas that contribute to the meaning, style, form and presentation of a dance. These elements include costume, make-up and hair, props, set, sound design and lighting."
Dance,Physical skills,"Physical skills underpin movement and movement vocabulary of any dance style and are developed over time through imitation, repetition, refinement and muscle memory, where a dancer's body remembers how to execute particular movements. Physical skills include coordination, balance, control, flexibility, strength and alignment of body parts."
Dance,Refine,Making alterations and improvements to an existing dance or movement sequence. Refinement is often used in conjunction with evaluation.
Dance,Rehearsal,"The practices of learning existing movements through repetition, feedback and skill development to consolidate, remember and refine execution of the choreography. Generally, no major changes to choreography occur beyond this point."
Dance,Repetition,Repetition in dance refers to the repeated execution of a sequence of movements in order for the movement to be remembered. Repetition also refers to a repeated series of movements in a choreography.
Dance,Safe dance practice,"Dance learning should take place in a safe environment that welcomes diversity of culture, gender and sexuality. Opportunities for regular practice that are appropriate to levels of learning is encouraged to avoid injury. Dance sessions should begin with a warm-up and end with a cool-down. Dance spaces should be an appropriate size to ensure relevant distance and proximity. The wearing of comfortable and appropriate clothing also contributes to safe practices in dance."
Dance,Space,"Space refers to qualities such as shape, the organisation of dancers in a space, travelling, staying still, level and focus."
Dance,Symmetrical,Group formations that appear to be even when divided by a central line from the perspective of an audience. Symmetry can also be created in a single dancer's body.
Dance,Technical skills,Technical skills relate to the proficiency with which a dancer can execute certain movements. Technical skills are developed over time and may also relate to particular dance styles.
