Digital Technologies,TLS,*See:* Transport Layer Security
Digital Technologies,Trace,"The process of following an algorithm precisely to confirm that it produces the expected output for a given input. For example, a trace table allows for the manual checking of any logical errors."
Digital Technologies,Training data,A large data set that is used to train a machine learning model to make predictions or decisions.
Digital Technologies,Translation tool,A software tool that translates text in one spoken language to text in another spoken language.
Digital Technologies,Transmission Control Protocol (TCP),A standard that enables data as packets to be shared between computing devices over a network using software applications.
Digital Technologies,Transport Layer Security (TLS),"A cryptographic protocol that is used to provide security over a network. TLS is used to encrypt the communication between web applications and servers. This includes email, messaging and web browsers."
Digital Technologies,Trusted adult,"A reliable person whom children feel comfortable talking to if they are upset or need help when engaged in online activities. They might include family members, carers and teachers."
Digital Technologies,Types of data,"General categories of data that can be transmitted between digital systems, such as text (e.g. text messages), numeric (e.g. sporting results), sound (e.g. streamed music) and images (e.g. photos)."
Digital Technologies,Unicode,"An encoding system used to represent characters expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Character representations consist of the letter U followed by a plus sign and a hexadecimal number. For example, the English upper-case letter E is represented by the code U+0045, whereas the French upper-case letter Ê (with a circumflex) is represented by the code U+00CA."
Digital Technologies,Uniform Resource Locator (URL),A reference to an address of a resource on the internet. This is used to locate a file on the internet. The URL consists of the protocol and the domain name or IP address.
Digital Technologies,Universal Serial Bus (USB),"An industry standard that specifies the protocols for sharing data between devices, connecting and powering devices. Devices include PCs and laptops; peripherals such as keyboards, headsets and mouses; and storage devices such as flash drives and external hard drives."

Digital Technologies,User experience,"Aspects (e.g. navigation design, visual design, expertise of user and ergonomics) that affect how a user interacts with digital systems."
Digital Technologies,User interface,"The characteristics of the boundary between users and a digital system**,** or the manner in which users interact with digital system components (hardware and software). For software, this usually comprises fields for text and number entry, mouse pointers, buttons and other graphical elements. For hardware, switches, dials and LEDs provide information about the interactions between a user and machine."
Digital Technologies,Validate,"Check that input data, such as its accuracy, consistency, completeness and bias, is reasonable."
Digital Technologies,Variable,"A data value that can change depending on the conditions during the running of a program. A variable is the named, stored location where a data value is held."
Digital Technologies,Virtual reality (VR),"A self-contained environment in which a user can immerse themselves in simulated surroundings. A range of sensors such as headsets and gloves are used to assist the user in the simulated environment. There are 3 types of VR: non-immersive, semi-immersive and fully immersive."
Digital Technologies,Visual program/programming,"Programming languages or environments in which a program is represented and created visually rather than as text. A common visual metaphor represents statements and control structures as blocks that can be composed to form programs, allowing programming without syntax errors. Examples of visual programming languages are Alice, GameMaker, Kodu, LEGO Mindstorms, MIT App Inventor and Scratch (Build Your Own Blocks and Snap). A visual programming language is not the same as a programming language for creating visualisations or programs with user interfaces (e.g. Processing or Visual Basic)."
Digital Technologies,Visualise data,Present data in a summarised form to help with communication and analysis (e.g. sorting and presenting data as a chart showing spending trends to help make financial decisions).
Digital Technologies,VR,*See:* virtual reality
Digital Technologies,WAV,*See:* Waveform Audio File Format
Digital Technologies,Waveform Audio File Format (WAV),An audio file format for storing audio data. WAV files are usually uncompressed.
Digital Technologies,Wired network,A digital system that uses cables (or wires) to establish connections to the internet and allows the transmission of data to other digital systems.
Digital Technologies,Wireframe,A design tool that uses placeholders to represent the visual elements of a design. It is a visual layout that represents all the elements that will appear on a webpage.
Digital Technologies,Wireless network,"A digital system that can transmit data to, or receive data from, other systems without using cables (e.g. transmitted via microwave signals, radio frequencies, and Bluetooth and infrared devices). For example, home wi-fi uses radio frequencies to communicate between digital devices such as a laptop, printer and router."
Digital Technologies,Workload,"The computational requirements of a digital system (e.g. the effort required by a gaming server to meet storage, communication and processing demands)."
Digital Technologies,XML,*See:* Extensible Markup Language
Digital Technologies,XOR,A form of symmetric encryption in which the same cryptographic key is used to encrypt and decrypt a message.
