Students develop questions and locate, collect and record information and data from a range of sources in a range of formats. They represent and analyse the information collected and draw conclusions. Students propose considered actions or responses and their impact. They use ideas from sources, geographical knowledge and concepts (space, interconnection and environment) to describe the diversity of places and environments.",Refined for clarity and improved alignment to content descriptions and geographical concepts
HASS,Geography,Levels 5 and 6,"By the end of Level 6, students describe and explain spatial characteristics and characteristics of places from local to global scales. They describe and explain interconnections and their effects. They identify and describe locations including the major countries of Europe, North America and Asia.
They identify and compare responses to a geographical challenge, describing the expected effects on different groups.
They ethically collect and record relevant geographical data and information and represent data and information in forms including diagrams, field sketches and large scale and small scale maps that conform to cartographic conventions.
They interpret geographical data and information, and use geographical terminology, to identify and develop descriptions, explanations and conclusions. They use digital and spatial technologies to represent and interpret data and information.","By the end of Level 6, students explain the influence of people on the characteristics of places, how they change and their sustainable management. They identify the major geographical divisions of the world and explain the geographical diversity of places and the impacts of interconnections between Australia and other countries. Students explain bushfires and other climate hazards and consider how their impacts can be reduced. They analyse some of the major economic, demographic and social differences between countries around the world.
Students develop questions, and locate, collect and organise information and data from a range of primary and secondary sources. They represent and interpret information in different formats to describe patterns, trends and relationships. They analyse information and develop evidence-based conclusions. Students propose actions or responses to an issue or challenge and use criteria to assess the possible impacts. They select and organise ideas and findings from sources, using geographical knowledge and concepts (place, interconnection, environment and sustainability) to present descriptions and explanations.",Refined for clarity and improved alignment to content descriptions and geographical concepts
HASS,Geography,Levels 7 and 8,"By the end of Level 8, students explain processes that influence the characteristics of places. They identify, analyse and explain interconnections and spatial characteristics and identity and explain their implications.
They compare strategies for a geographical challenge, taking into account a range of factors and predict the likely outcomes.
They ethically collect, record and select relevant geographical data and information from useful sources. They select and represent data and information in a range of appropriate forms including maps at different scales that conform to cartographic conventions. They analyse maps and other geographical data and information, and use geographical terminology, to develop identifications, descriptions, explanations and conclusions. They use digital and spatial technologies to represent and analyse data and information.","By the end of Level 8, students explain the interconnections between people and places and environments, and environmental processes. They explain how these interconnections change places or environments. Students explain responses or strategies to address a geographical phenomenon, issue or challenge, referring to environmental, economic or social factors. They explain the sustainable management of water as a valuable renewable resource. Students explain liveability and consider the ways in which it is measured and changed by people. They analyse ways that human activities change landforms and landscapes and ways of managing and protecting them. Students explain the processes and patterns of urbanisation, issues for the sustainability of Australia’s cities and impacts of climate change. 
Students develop relevant questions about a geographical phenomenon, issue or challenge. They collect, organise, process and represent information and data from primary and secondary sources using geospatial technologies. Students interpret and analyse data and information to explain patterns and trends and infer relationships. They draw reasoned conclusions, consider ethical values about the impact of the geographical phenomenon, issue or challenge. Students decide on appropriate strategies for action and explain potential impacts. Students create descriptions, explanations and actions, using geographical knowledge, methods and concepts, and they reference findings from appropriate sources.","Refined for clarity and improved alignment to content descriptions and geographical concepts.
