Students sequence events and people (their lifetime) in chronological order, and represent time by creating timelines. They identify a range of sources and locate and compare information about the origin, content features and the purpose of historical sources. Students describe the historical context of these sources to describe perspectives of people from the past and recognise different points of view. Students develop texts, particularly narratives and descriptions of continuity and change. In developing these texts and organising and presenting their information, students create an explanation about a past event, person or group using sources of evidence and historical terms and concepts.",Refined and included more relevance to content descriptions and historical concepts
History,Levels 7 and 8,"By the end of Level 8, students can analyse different interpretations of the establishment of early societies, explain global patterns of continuity and change and the sources of historical evidence of the period.
