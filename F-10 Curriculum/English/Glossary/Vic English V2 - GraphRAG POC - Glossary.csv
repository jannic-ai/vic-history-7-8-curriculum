English,English,Adjective,"A word class that describes, identifies or quantifies a noun or a pronoun, for example ‘two’ (number or quantity), ‘my’ (possessive), ‘ancient’ (descriptive), ‘shorter’ (comparative) and ‘wooden’ (classifying)."
English,English,Adverb,"A word class that may modify a verb (e.g. ‘beautifully’ in ‘She sings beautifully’), an adjective (e.g. ‘really’ in ‘He is really interesting’) or another adverb (e.g. ‘very’ in ‘She walks very slowly’). In English, many adverbs have an -ly ending."
English,English,Adverbial,"A word or group of words that contributes additional but non-essential information to the larger structure of a clause.

An adverbial can contribute circumstantial information to a clause (e.g. about place, such as ‘outside’ in ‘I spoke with him outside’ or when or how, such as ‘quickly’ in ‘She responded quickly’). It can also contribute evaluative interpersonal meaning to a clause (e.g. ‘frankly’ in ‘Frankly, I don’t care’).

Adverbs, adverb groups, prepositional phrases, nouns and noun groups can function as an adverbial in a clause (e.g. ‘tentatively’ in ‘They opened the letter tentatively’ or ‘on the beach’ in ‘The dog was running on the beach’).

An alternative term for ‘adverbial’ is ‘adjunct’."

English,English,Clause,"A grammatical unit referring to a happening or state. A clause creates a message through the combination of a subject (the element being identified for comment) and its predicate (the comment about the subject, which contains a verb), for example ‘I (subject) shall eat my dinner (predicate).’

There are different kinds of clauses. The clause that is essential to any sentence is an independent (or main) clause.

Compound and complex sentences contain more than one clause.

A clause that provides additional information to the independent clause but cannot stand alone is a dependent (or subordinate) clause. For example:

• ‘When the sun goes down (dependent), I shall eat my dinner (independent).’

• ‘My time is limited (independent) because I am reading Shakespeare (dependent).’

An embedded clause occurs within the structure of another clause, often as a qualifier to a noun group. For example:

• ‘The man who came to dinner (embedded) is my brother.’"
English,English,Cohesion,"Grammatical or lexical relationships that bind different parts of a text together and give it unity. Cohesion is achieved through various devices such as connectives, ellipses and word associations (sometimes called lexical cohesion). These associations include synonyms (words similar in meaning, for example ‘big’/‘large’ and ‘easy’/‘simple’), antonyms (words opposite in meaning, for example ‘study’/’laze about’ and ‘ugly’/’beautiful’), repetition (‘Work, work, work – that’s all we do!’), word sets (e.g. class-sub-class or part-whole sets) and collocation (using words that go with each other, e.g. ‘friend’ and ‘pal’ in ‘My friend did me a big favour last week.

English,English,Complex sentence,"A sentence containing an independent (or main) clause and one or more dependent (or subordinate) clauses. The dependent clause is joined to the independent clause through subordinating conjunctions like ‘when’, ‘while’ and ‘before’.

A complex sentence will not make sense without an independent clause. In the following example, the dependent clause is underlined and the conjunction is in bold: ‘When the sun came out, we all went outside.’"
English,English,Compound sentence,"A sentence consisting of 2 or more independent (main) clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions like ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘but’ and ‘so’. Each clause is coordinated or linked so as to give each one equal status as a message. In the following example, the coordinating conjunction is underlined and verbs are highlighted: ‘The sun emerged and we all went outside.’"
English,English,Comprehension strategies,"Strategies and processes used by readers to make meaning from texts. Key comprehension strategies used by readers include:

• activating and using prior knowledge

• identifying literal information explicitly stated in the text

• making inferences based on information in the text and their own prior knowledge

• predicting likely future events in a text

• visualising by creating mental images of elements in a text

• summarising and organising information from a text

• integrating ideas and information in texts

• critically reflecting on content, structure, language and images used to construct meaning in a text."

English,English,Conjunction,"A word that joins other words, phrases or clauses together in logical relationships such as addition, time, cause or comparison. There are 2 major types of conjunctions for linking messages: coordinating conjunctions and subordinating conjunctions.

• Coordinating conjunctions are words that link words, phrases and clauses in such a way that the elements have equal status in meaning. They include conjunctions like ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘but’, as in the following examples:

  - ‘Mum and Dad are here’ (joining words)

  - ‘We visited some of our friends, but not all of them’ (joining noun groups)

  - ‘Did I fall asleep and miss my dinner?’ (joining clauses)

• Subordinating conjunctions introduce certain kinds of dependent clauses, as in the following examples:

  - ‘that’ simply marks declaratives, for example ‘I know that he is ill’

  - ‘whether’ (or ‘if’ when it is used in the same way as ‘whether’) marks interrogatives: ‘I wonder whether/if she’s right’

  - ‘while’, ‘after’, ‘when’, ‘because’ and ‘if’ (in the conditional sense) mark the kind of dependent clause the word introduces, for example one of time, reason or condition: ‘We went home after/when the meeting ended’, ‘They stayed in because it was raining’ or ‘I'll do it if you pay me’"
English,English,Connective,"Words that link paragraphs and sentences in logical relationships of time, cause and effect, comparison or addition. Connectives relate ideas to one another and help to show the logic of the information. They are important resources for creating cohesion in texts. The logical relationships can be grouped as follows:

• temporal – to indicate time or to sequence ideas (e.g. ‘first’, ‘second’ or ‘next’)

• causal – to show cause and effect (e.g. ‘because’, ‘for’ or ‘so’)

• additive – to add information (e.g. ‘also’, ‘besides’ or ‘furthermore’)

• comparative – to make comparisons (e.g. ‘rather’ or ‘alternatively’)

• conditional/concessive – to make conditions or concession (e.g. ‘yet’ or ‘although’)

• clarifying – to make clear (e.g. ‘in fact’ or ‘for example’)"

Following decoding, readers draw on contextual, vocabulary and grammatical knowledge to make meaning and recognise when they make an error (for example when reading words that are spelled the same but are pronounced differently), self-correcting when they do."
English,English,Dependent clause,"A clause that cannot make complete sense on its own: it needs to be combined with an independent clause to form a complete sentence. The dependent clause can be introduced by a finite verb, like ‘goes’ in the following sentence: ‘When the sun goes down, I shall eat my dinner.’ It can also be introduced by non-finite verbs, as in ‘going’ in the following sentence: ‘From 1966 to 2001 the total population decreased, going from 11,800 down to 11,077.’"
English,English,Design,"The way particular elements are selected and used in the process of text construction for particular purposes.

A letter may have more than one sound, such as the letter ‘a’ in ‘was’, ‘can’ or ‘father’, and a sound can be represented by more than one letter, such as the sound /k/ in ‘cat’ and ‘walk’. The word ‘ship’ has 3 sounds: /sh/, /i/, and /p/; but it has 4 letters: ‘s’, ‘h’, ‘i’ and ‘p’. Teachers should use the terms ‘sound’ and ‘letter’ accurately to help students clearly distinguish between the 2."

These places vary greatly over the various landscapes and seascapes across the continent. There are some parts of Country that have landmarks that directly relate to the ancestor spirits and the creation of existence. These are especially important as culturally significant places and need to be cared for. There are also other places on Country that are important for ceremony, as mentioned above, which are also considered especially important for Aboriginal communities."

• simple sentence: has the form of a single independent clause (e.g. ‘Mary is beautiful.’, ‘The ground shook.’ or ‘Take a seat.’)

• compound sentence: contains 2 or more clauses that are coordinated or linked in such a way as to give each clause equal status. In the following example, ‘and’ is the coordinating conjunction: ‘We went to the movies and bought an ice cream.’

• complex sentence: contains an independent (or main) clause and one or more dependent (or subordinate) clauses. The dependent clause is joined to the independent clause through subordinating conjunctions like ‘when’, ‘while’ and ‘before’, as in the following examples: ‘We all went outside when the sun came out.’ and ‘Because I am reading Shakespeare, my time is limited.’

• compound-complex sentence: contains at least 2 independent clauses and at least one dependent clause. A compound-complex sentence can express longer and more complex thoughts and/or ideas (e.g. ‘At 6 o’clock this morning, I went to feed the animals but I realised I had run out of hay.’)"

Examples of stylistic features include narrative viewpoint, structure of stanzas, and juxtaposition."
English,English,Subject,"An element in the structure of a clause, usually filled by a noun or noun group, that is enacting the verb, for example ‘The dog (subject) was barking’. The normal position of the subject is before the verb or verb group, but in most kinds of interrogative it follows the first auxiliary verb, for example ‘Was the dog barking?’ or ‘Why was the dog barking?’.

In independent clauses the subject is an obligatory element, except in imperative clauses and casual style, for example ‘There will be no milk left.’

Most personal pronouns have a different form when they are the subject of a finite clause (‘I’, ‘he’, ‘she’, etc.) than when they are the object (‘me’, ‘him’, ‘her’), for example ‘She won the race’, not ‘Her won the race’. In the present tense, and the past tense with the verb ‘be’, the verb agrees with the subject in person and number, for example ‘Her son lives with her’ and ‘Her sons live with her’."

Texts can be expressions of meaning in written, spoken, visual and multimodal forms and can incorporate language, sound, print, film, electronic and multimodal representations."
English,English,Text navigation,"The way in which readers move through text. Readers generally read novels in a linear fashion from the beginning to the end; readers of non-fiction books often use the contents page and index and move between chapters according to the information they are seeking. Readers often read digital texts more flexibly, according to interest and purpose, using hyperlinks to move between pages and digital objects, such as videos or animations, making quick judgements about relevance of material."
English,English,Text structure,"The ways information is organised in different types of texts, for example chapter headings, subheadings, tables of contents, indexes and glossaries, overviews, introductory and concluding paragraphs, sequencing, topic sentences, taxonomies, and cause and effect. Choices in text structures and language features together define a text type and shape its purpose and meaning. See also: Language features."
English,English,Theme,"The main idea or message of a text.

Theme is important at different levels of text organisation. The topic sentence serves as the theme for the points raised in a paragraph. A pattern of themes contributes to the method of development for the text as a whole.

Grammatical theme indicates importance both within a clause and across a text. In a clause, the theme comes in first position and indicates what the sentence is about."
English,English,Tone,The mood created by the language features used by an author and the way the text makes the reader feel.
English,English,Types of texts (or text types),"Classifications according to the particular purposes a text is designed to achieve. These purposes influence the characteristic features that texts employ. In general, in the English curriculum, texts can be classified as belonging to one of 3 types – narrative, informative or persuasive – although it is acknowledged that these distinctions are neither static nor watertight, and that particular texts can belong to more than one category:

• narrative texts: texts whose primary purpose is to entertain through their imaginative use of literary elements. They are recognised for their form, style and artistic or aesthetic value. These texts include novels, traditional tales, poetry, stories, plays, fiction for young adults and children (including picture books), and multimodal texts such as film.

• informative texts: texts whose primary purpose is to provide information. They include texts that are culturally important in society and are valued for their informative content, as a store of knowledge and for their value as part of everyday life. These texts include explanations and descriptions of natural phenomena, recounts of events, instructions and directions, rules and laws, and news bulletins.

• persuasive texts: texts whose primary purpose is to put forward a point of view and persuade a reader, viewer or listener. They form a significant part of modern communication in both print and digital environments. These texts include advertising, debates, arguments, discussions, polemics and influential essays and articles.

• See also: Genre."
English,English,Values,Ideas and beliefs specific to individuals and groups.
English,English,Verb,"Verbs tell us what kind of situation is described in a clause – in particular, whether it is a happening or a state – but they often need other elements to locate the situation in time, to indicate polarity (positive or negative), aspect (whether the situation is completed or not) or modality (the assessment the speaker is making about the situation):

• doing: for example ‘She climbed the ladder.’

• being: for example ‘The koala is an Australian mammal.’

• having: for example ‘The house has several rooms.’

• thinking: for example ‘She believes in her work.’

• saying: for example ‘The Prime Minister spoke to the media.’

• relating: for example ‘I am older than him.’

Verbs are essential to clause structure and change their form according to tense (present tense or past tense), to person (first, second or third) and to number (singular or plural)."
English,English,Verb groups,"Groups of words that are centred on a verb and consist of one or more verbs. The main verb in a verb group often needs auxiliary (or helping) verbs to indicate features like time (past or present), polarity (positive or negative), aspect (whether the action is completed or not) and modality (the assessment of the speaker about the action).

All of the following verbs contribute to the meaning of the verb group as a whole: ‘the girl played soccer’, ‘the girl was playing/had been playing soccer’, ‘the girl was not playing soccer’ and ‘the girl could have been playing soccer’."
English,English,Viewing,"Observing with purpose, understanding and critical awareness. See also: Reading.

Students may participate in viewing activities by watching or looking and/or listening to a text (such as a film, diagram or picture) or by listening to a speaker describe the visual features of a text (such as a diagram, picture or multimedia)."
English,English,Visual features,"Visual components of a text such as placement, salience, framing, representation of action or reaction, shot size, social distance and camera angle."
English,English,Voice,"In English grammar, voice is used to describe the contrast between such pairs of clauses as ‘The dog bit me’ (active voice) and ‘I was bitten by the dog’ (passive voice). Active and passive clauses differ in the way participant roles are associated with grammatical functions.

In clauses expressing actions, like the above examples, the subject of the active clause (the dog) has the role of actor, and the object (me) the role of patient, whereas in the passive clause the subject (I) has the role of patient and the object of the preposition (the dog) the role of actor.

In clauses that describe situations other than actions, such as ‘Everyone admired the minister’ and ‘The minister was admired by everyone’, the same grammatical difference is found, so that the object of the active clause (the minister) corresponds to the subject of the passive clause, and the subject of the active clause (everyone) corresponds to the object of the preposition ‘by’.

Voice can also mean the distinct personality of a piece of writing or the individual writing style of a composer, created through the way they use and mix various language features (e.g. a narrative using a child’s voice)."
English,English,Vowel,"A letter of the alphabet (a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y) that represents a speech sound created by the relatively free passage of breath through the larynx and oral cavity."
English,English,Vowel digraph,"Two successive vowels that represent a single phoneme (e.g. /ai/ in the word ‘rain’, /ea/ in the word ‘beach’ and /ee/ in the word ‘free’)."
English,English,Word origins,The historical development of words from their earliest known use. Word origin (etymology) tracks the transfer of words from one language to another.
English,English,Writing,"Planning, composing, editing and publishing texts in print or digital forms. Writing usually involves activities using pencils, pens or word processors, and/or using drawings, models or photos to represent text, and/or using a scribe to record responses or produce recorded responses."
