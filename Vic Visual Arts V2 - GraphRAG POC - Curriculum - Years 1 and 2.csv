Levels 1 and 2,Exploring,,VC2AVA2E01,"Explore where, when, why and how people across cultures, communities, times, places and/or other contexts experience visual arts, including artworks created by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples",,"Exploring when, where, how and why Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples use visual arts, crafts and designs to share knowledge about cultures, for example during, but not limited to, celebrations such as National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children's Day, National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee (NAIDOC) Week and National Reconciliation Week or to acknowledge significant occasions such as National Sorry Day"
Levels 1 and 2,Exploring,,VC2AVA2E01,"Explore where, when, why and how people across cultures, communities, times, places and/or other contexts experience visual arts, including artworks created by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples",,"Identifying similarities and differences in artworks that represent subject matter or ideas they may be exploring in other learning areas; for example, exploring artworks that represent significant events from different times"
Levels 1 and 2,Exploring,,VC2AVA2E01,"Explore where, when, why and how people across cultures, communities, times, places and/or other contexts experience visual arts, including artworks created by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples",,"Observing how visual conventions are used in artworks and designs created by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, for example by exploring colours, symbols and patterns used in artworks, with representatives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities or through resources that are created or co-created by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples"
Levels 1 and 2,Developing Practices,,VC2AVA2D01,"Explore ways of using visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials",,"Using viewpoints to develop thinking routines and to reflect on their arts experiences, for example ‘What was challenging about working in a limited timeframe?’, ‘What was something new that I discovered about the material?’ and ‘What failures led to new discoveries?’"
Levels 1 and 2,Developing Practices,,VC2AVA2D01,"Explore ways of using visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials",,"Playing with a range of natural and/or constructed materials to experiment with visual conventions and visual arts processes; for example, creating mud sculptures or using sticks, leaves and playdough to explore texture"
Levels 1 and 2,Developing Practices,,VC2AVA2D01,"Explore ways of using visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials",,"Examining artworks and trialling layering as a way of building surfaces, colour, texture and interest; for example, experimenting to create a layered world with pastels, then watercolour, ink and wax, and identifying how each material could be used in a future artwork once the experiment is complete"
Levels 1 and 2,Developing Practices,,VC2AVA2D01,"Explore ways of using visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials",,"Exploring visual conventions using a wide range of materials, for example by creating lines using media such as pastels, chalk, paint, ripped paper, textiles and markers, or going on a ‘line hunt’ to identify and photograph the different lines they see around their school environment using a digital camera or creating rubbings"
Levels 1 and 2,Creating,,VC2AVA2C01,"Use visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials to create artworks that communicate ideas, experiences and observations",,"Using viewpoints and brainstorming to develop ideas for artworks as they experiment with visual conventions, subject matter and materials, for example ‘What happens if I make the subject fill the page?’, ‘Can I change the meaning of my work by using darker or lighter tones?’, ‘What happens if I combine these ideas?’, ‘How can I adapt this idea?’ and ‘What happens if I remove part of this design?’"
Levels 1 and 2,Creating,,VC2AVA2C01,"Use visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials to create artworks that communicate ideas, experiences and observations",,"Using a combination of chaotic/accidental mark-making with more detailed intentional mark-making; for example, using blobs of paint with added outlines and detail, then using imagination and creativity to build on the shapes to see what emerges"
Levels 1 and 2,Creating,,VC2AVA2C01,"Use visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials to create artworks that communicate ideas, experiences and observations",,"Creating a relief print through nature-printing or creating collagraphs with a raised textured surface using glue, thread/string and textured paper to print monoprints, cutting these shapes out and making a collage with a recognisable form, such as a face or an animal"
Levels 1 and 2,Creating,,VC2AVA2C01,"Use visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials to create artworks that communicate ideas, experiences and observations",,"Using 3D construction (sculpture) methods to represent subject matter or ideas being explored in another learning area; for example, building on their understanding of living things as a starting point to use modelling materials such as potato, clay and found objects to represent the life cycle of an insect"
Levels 1 and 2,Creating,,VC2AVA2C01,"Use visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials to create artworks that communicate ideas, experiences and observations",,"Using a combination of digital and physical materials and processes to make artworks, such as using photography or drawing apps for painting and drawing to create a collaged abstract work that represents feelings and emotions; for example, responding to music with colour, line and shape to create an artwork that communicates how the music makes them feel"
Levels 1 and 2,Presenting,,VC2AVA2P01,Present and share artworks in informal settings,,"Presenting and describing an artwork they have made to the class, a small group or their teacher and explaining what they like about it"
Levels 1 and 2,Presenting,,VC2AVA2P01,Present and share artworks in informal settings,,"Creating and presenting a spontaneous and experimental artwork, such as using unlikely objects for brushes, testing colours and ‘brushstrokes’ using expressive movements, then applying a cardboard ‘window’ across the finished painting"
Levels 1 and 2,Presenting,,VC2AVA2P01,Present and share artworks in informal settings,,"Using an everyday object as the starting point, drawing the object, then taking it in turns to match each student’s artwork with the appropriate object, explaining how they arrived at their decision"
Levels 1 and 2,Presenting,,VC2AVA2P01,Present and share artworks in informal settings,,"Deciding on an appropriate audience and ways to share their artworks; for example, sharing a work in progress with the class or posting their work on a school learning management system"
